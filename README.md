# Employee
WEbServices and WebSite with DJango-Python


Description.

This site allows the administration of employees entering by user password and password.
It allows the registration of new employees, editing of data, delete an employee and listing of registered employees.
The site consumes web services to perform the operations of consultation, registration, editing and delete employees.



The project is divided into two sites:

1.- Backend: Provides webservices for data maintenance

2.- FrondEnd: View that consumes web services and gives the user an alternative to manage records.

CHARACTERISTICS

-------- BackEnd:

   The backend services were developed with the python framework, Django. The database is SQLite.

   A custom class was created for paging the records (PageNumberPagination), accepting Limit as a parameter in the service.

   Security level with token was implemented, I think that for websites it is better to use session (rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication) but thinking about portability for mobile applications I decided to leave it as a token using rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication.

   CORS was integrated for the cross-accesses, the white list of the origins and the permissions in the methods are kept, these are configured in the file settings.py

   The services (with the exception of the api-token-auth / service) require the authorization header to assign this property the value of the token that the api-token-auth / service returns. If the token is not assigned, the services will return an error 401-Unauthorizes (invalid token)

   The users are created in the database structure created by the Migration of the DJango security model.



    
-------- FrondEnd:

   The application was integrated into the same project but as an independent application.

   For the view, the decision was made to use bootstrap for the ease of layout, for the integration with html, css and javascript, for the use of LESS and for the simplicity of use.

   For the integration of html and javascript the decision was made to use the VueJS framework because I think it integrates the best of React and Angular, it is a progressive framework, use of templates and components, it is also very easy to use and facilitates the development.
   The consumption of webservices was done with AXIOS taking advantage of the advantages that it has to consume webservices RESTFull with Ajax and its simplicity to use it
   
   Note: The pagination is not implemented in the frontend, the webservice already receives the parameter for pagination.
   
   
   
WEBSERVICES

- Login: This service authenticates the user. Users are created from the Django administrator. Currently there is only the administrator user:

       user: admin

  This service requires the JSON chain to be sent:     
  {
	  "username":"admin",
